**Project Title: Image Segmentation using Scikit-image**

**Overview:**
This project focuses on image segmentation using the scikit-image library in Python. Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, where the goal is to partition an image into multiple segments or regions of interest. This README provides an overview of the project, including prerequisites, technologies used, and guidance on how to get started.

**Skills Required:**
- Image Processing
- Image Segmentation
- Noise Removal
- Hands-on experience with Python
- Understanding of image processing techniques

**Technologies Used:**
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image

**Prerequisites:**
To successfully work on this project, you should have a basic understanding of image processing techniques and experience with Python programming. Familiarity with the technologies mentioned above would be beneficial but not mandatory. It's recommended to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-image

**Installation:**
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-image
```
3. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ShazaAzher/Image-Segmentation-Using-Scikit-Learn.git
```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Image-Segmentation-Using-Scikit-Learn
```

**Usage:**
- Once you have set up the environment and installed the necessary libraries, you can start experimenting with image segmentation using scikit-image.
- You can find sample images in the `images` directory to perform segmentation on.
- Use the provided Python scripts as a reference to understand various segmentation techniques and customize them according to your requirements.
